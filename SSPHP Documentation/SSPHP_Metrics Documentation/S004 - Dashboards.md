## SERVICE DASHBOARD
This dashboard is for the Service Owners, the technical owners responsible for remediation, and for Risk Managers. It shows the list of all the Controls, their Scores, and their compliance statuses.

The top row is the overall Compliance situation for the Service as a whole. This will be displayed either be as an 'absolute' (ie X of Y) or a 'percentage' (ie N%). In order to change to/from absolute/percentage - click 'show filters' at the top, and the options will appear. The filters also offer the option to change to view the compliance status of a different Foundational Service.

The description text below the Service status says "<service> Compliant of # DfE Mandated Controls".... so, when the display is 'absolute', the 2nd number (Y) is the total number of Controls for the Service that are DfE Mandated. The first number (X) is the number of Controls for the Service that are DfE Mandated and the status is 'Compliant'.

The 2nd row shows the name of the Service,and below, in [], is the total number of Controls that are eing monitored for that Service. This will include CIS Controls, DfE Controls, and any other Controls from any source that are relevant to the Service.

Also on the 2nd row are the 'Show Only' checkboxes, which are both clear by default. By checking either or both of these boxes, the Controls listed in the table below is reduced to include only Non-Compliant +/- Dfe Mandated Controls. The [] number of Controls to the left will change according the number in the list below ie according to the filter. The numbers in the Service status row will be unaffected by these filters.

The 3rd row is the list table of the Controls for the Service, filtered as above. The columns 'Score' and 'Compliance Status' are colour coded as follows :
Compliant = Green
DfE Mandated & Non-Compliant = Red
Recommended & Non-Compliant = Orange
Desirable & Non-Compliant = White

By default, the rows are sorted so that all the DfE Mandated Controls are at the top, then Recommended, then Desirable. Within each of these categories, the Non-Compliant Controls are at the top.

Clicking anywhere on a row will open the Detail Dashboard in a new browser tab, and the context will automatically be set to the Control that was clicked.
