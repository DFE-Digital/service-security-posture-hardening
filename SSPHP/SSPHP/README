<ins>Installation of the app from scratch</ins>


Steps : 

1. Installing the app from scratch involves first removing (uninstalling) the previous version of the app if there was one. Do this using 'Manage Apps' option in the Splunk Web UI.

2. Now upload and install the tar.gz for the app package that you have built, again using the Web UI.

3. Certain lookup csv files need to exist and they must be created by manually running saved searches. There are dependencies between the searches o create the csv files, so the order to run the queries in should be as follows :

    3.1. ssphp_create_resource_service_map_csv creates ssphp_resource_service_map.csv
    3.2. ssphp_create_base_azure_resource_list_csv creates ssphp_azure_resource_list.csv

    3.3 ssphp_create_github_public_repo_list_csv creates ssphp_github_public_repo_list.csv
    3.4 ssphp_create_github_repo_service_map_csv creates ssphp_github_repo_service_map.csv

    3.5 ssphp_create_map_ip_to_azure_rg_csv creates ssphp_map_ip_to_azure_rg.csv
    3.6 ssphp_create_qualys_service_list_csv creates ssphp_qualys_service_list.csv

    3.7 You might also want to manually run the use case searches so that there in a uptodate version of the data in the summary index

4. Accelerate the SSPHP data model **in your app**

By default, all saved searches are configured to be 'disabled' in the code savedsearches.conf. This means that any new saved searches will need to be manually enabled in the webui, as will all saved searches when thge app is installed from scratch.
