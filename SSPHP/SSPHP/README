SSPHP App
=========


Installation of the app from scratch
------------------------------------

Steps : 

1. Installing the app from scratch involves first removing (uninstalling) the previous version of the app if there was one. Do this using 'Manage Apps' option in the Splunk Web UI.

2. Using 'Manage Apps' in the Web UI, you will first need to manually create a template barebones app called SSPHP (or SSPHP_DEV depending).
    2.1 App ID = SSPHP_DEV
    2.2 Description = DfE Service Security Posture Hardening Programme [DEVELOPMENT]

3. Now upload and install the tar.gz for the app package that you have built, again using the Web UI.

4. Certain lookup csv files need to exist and they must be created by manually running saved searches. There are dependencies between the searches o create the csv files, so the order to run the queries in should be as follows :

    4.1. ssphp_create_resource_service_map_csv creates ssphp_resource_service_map.csv
    4.2.
