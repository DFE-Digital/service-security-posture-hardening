To enhance your enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or monitor traffic between internal resources using network controls. For specific well-defined applications (such as a 3-tier app), this can be a highly secure ""deny by default, permit by exception"" approach by restricting the ports, protocols, source, and destination IPs of the network traffic. If you have many applications and endpoints interacting with each other, blocking traffic may not scale well and you may only be able to monitor traffic. 
Secure cloud services by establish a private access point for the resources. You should also disable or restrict access from public network when possible.

Deploy firewall to perform advanced filtering on network traffic to and from external networks. You can also use firewalls between internal segments to support a segmentation strategy. If required, use custom routes for your subnet to override the system route when you need to force the network traffic to go through a network appliance for security control purpose.

At minimum, block known bad IP addresses and high-risk protocols like remote management (like RDP and SSH) and intranet protocols like SMB and Kerberos.  
When managing a complex network environment, use tools to simplify, centralize and enhance the network security management.

If required, use custom routes for your subnet to override the system route when you need to force the network traffic to go through a network appliance for security control purpose.

At minimum, block known bad IP addresses and high-risk protocols like remote management (like RDP and SSH) and intranet protocols like SMB and Kerberos.

To enhance your enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or monitor traffic between internal resources using network controls.

Secure your identity and authentication system as a high priority in your organization's cloud security practice. Common security controls include the follow aspects: 
- Restrict privileged roles and accounts
- Require strong authentication for all privileged access
- Monitor and audit high risk activities
Use a centralized identity and authentication system to govern organization's identities and authentications for cloud and non-cloud resources. 

In a hybrid environment where you have on-premises applications or non-native cloud applications using legacy authentication, consider solutions such as cloud access security broker (CASB), application proxy, single sign-on (SSO)  to govern the access to these applications for the following benefits:
- Enforce a centralized strong authentication
- Monitor and control risky end-user activities 
- Monitor and remediate risky legacy applications activities
- Detect and prevent sensitive data transmission","Centralize Account Management

Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation across log data. For each log source, ensure that you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements.
Ensure your organization follows industry best practice to develop processes and plans to respond to security incidents on the cloud platforms. Be mindful about the shared responsibility model and the variances across IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services. This will have a direct impact to how you will collaborate with your cloud provider in incident response and handling activities such as incident notification and triage, evidence collection, investigation, eradication and recovery.

Regularly test the incident response plan and handling process to ensure they're up to date.

Equivalent",Protect,"Ensure your virtual network deployment aligns to your enterprise segmentation strategy defined in the GS-2. Any workload that could incur higher risk for the organization should be in isolated virtual networks. 
Example of high-risk workload can be one of the following natures:
- An application storing or processing highly sensitive data.
- An external network facing application accessible by public or users outside of your organization.
- An application using insecure architecture or containing vulnerabilities that cannot be easily remediated.

To enhance your enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or monitor traffic between internal resources using network controls. For specific well-defined applications (such as a 3-tier app), this can be a highly secure ""deny by default, permit by exception"" approach by restricting the ports, protocols, source, and destination IPs of the network traffic. If you have many applications and endpoints interacting with each other, blocking traffic may not scale well and you may only be able to monitor traffic. 
Secure cloud services by establish a private access point for the resources. You should also disable or restrict access from public network when possible.
Deploy firewall to perform advanced filtering on network traffic to and from external networks. You can also use firewalls between internal segments to support a segmentation strategy. If required, use custom routes for your subnet to override the system route when you need to force the network traffic to go through a network appliance for security control purpose.

At minimum, block known bad IP addresses and high-risk protocols like remote management (like RDP and SSH) and intranet protocols like SMB and Kerberos.  
When managing a complex network environment, use tools to simplify, centralize and enhance the network security management.
Detect and disable insecure services and protocols at the OS, application, or software package layer. Deploy compensating controls if disabling insecure services and protocols are not possible.

Ensure the workload is secured throughout the entire lifecycle in development, testing, and deployment stage. Use Azure Security Benchmark to evaluate the controls (such as network security, identity management, privileged access and so on) that can be set as guardrails by default or shift left prior to the deployment stage. In particular, ensure the following controls are in place in your DevOps process: 
- Automate the deployment by using Azure or third-party tooling in the CI/CD workflow, infrastructure management (infrastructure as code), and testing to reduce human error and attack surface. 
- Ensure VM, container images and other artifacts are secure from malicious manipulation. 
- Scan the workload artifacts (i.e., container image, dependencies, SAST and DAST scan) prior to the deployment in the CI/CD workflow
- Deploy vulnerability assessment and threat detection capability into the production environment and continuously use these capabilities in the run-time.","Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process
