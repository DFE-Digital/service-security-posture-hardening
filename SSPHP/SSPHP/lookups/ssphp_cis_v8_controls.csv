",Equivalent,Protect,"Perform threat modeling to identify the potential threats and enumerate the mitigating controls. Ensure your threat modeling serves the following purposes:
- Secure your applications and services in the production run-time stage. 
- Secure the artifacts, underlying CI/CD pipeline and other tooling environment used for build, test, and deployment. 
The threat modeling at least should include the following aspects:
- Define the security requirements of the application. Ensure these requirements are adequately addressed in the threat modeling.
- Analyze application components, data connections and their relationship. Ensure this analysis also includes the upstream and downstream connections outside of your application scope.
- List the potential threats and attack vectors that your application components, data connections and upstream and downstream services may be exposed to. 
- Identify the applicable security controls that can be used to mitigate the threats enumerated and identify any controls gaps (i.e., security vulnerabilities) that may require additional treatment plan.
