16,16.9,Train Developers in Application Security Concepts and Secure Coding,Applications,2,"Ensure that all software development personnel receive training in writing secure code for their specific development environment and responsibilities. Training can include general security principles and application security standard practices. Conduct training at least annually and design in a way to promote security within the development team, and build a culture of security among the developers."
16,16.10,Apply Secure Design Principles in Application Architectures,Applications,2,"Apply secure design principles in application architectures. Secure design principles include the concept of least privilege and enforcing mediation to validate every operation that the user makes, promoting the concept of ""never trust user input."" Examples include ensuring that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. Secure design also means minimizing the application infrastructure attack surface, such as turning off unprotected ports and services, removing unnecessary programs and files, and renaming or removing default accounts."
16,16.11,Leverage Vetted Modules or Services for Application Security Components,Applications,2,"Leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging. Using platform features in critical security functions will reduce developers workload and minimize the likelihood of design or implementation errors. Modern operating systems provide effective mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization and make those mechanisms available to applications. Use only standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed encryption algorithms. Operating systems also provide mechanisms to create and maintain secure audit logs."
16,16.12,Implement Code-Level Security Checks,Applications,3,Apply static and dynamic analysis tools within the application life cycle to verify that secure coding practices are being followed.
16,16.13,Conduct Application Penetration Testing,Applications,3,"Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing.Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user."
16,16.14,Conduct Threat Modeling,Applications,3,"Conduct threat modeling. Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security design flaws within a design, before code is created. It is conducted through specially trained individuals who evaluate the application design and gauge security risks for each entry point and access level. The goal is to map out the application, architecture, and infrastructure in a structured way to understand its weaknesses."
17,17.1,Designate Personnel to Manage Incident Handling,N/A,1,"Designate one key person, and at least one backup, who will manage the enterprise's incident handling process. Management personnel are responsible for the coordination and documentation of incident response and recovery efforts and can consist of employees internal to the enterprise, third-party vendors, or a hybrid approach. If using a third-party vendor, designate at least one person internal to the enterprise to oversee any third-party work. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
17,17.2,Establish and Maintain Contact Information for Reporting Security Incidents,N/A,1,"Establish and maintain contact information for parties that need to be informed of security incidents. Contacts may include internal staff, third-party vendors, law enforcement, cyber insurance providers, relevant government agencies, Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) partners, or other stakeholders. Verify contacts annually to ensure that information is up-to-date."
17,17.3,Establish and Maintain an Enterprise Process for Reporting Incidents,N/A,1,"Establish and maintain an enterprise process for the workforce to report security incidents. The process includes reporting timeframe, personnel to report to, mechanism for reporting, and the minimum information to be reported. Ensure the process is publicly available to all of the workforce. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
17,17.4,Establish and Maintain an Incident Response Process,N/A,2,"Establish and maintain an incident response process that addresses roles and responsibilities, compliance requirements, and a communication plan. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
17,17.5,Assign Key Roles and Responsibilities,N/A,2,"Assign key roles and responsibilities for incident response, including staff from legal, IT, information security, facilities, public relations, human resources, incident responders, and analysts, as applicable. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
17,17.6,Define Mechanisms for Communicating During Incident Response,N/A,2,"Determine which primary and secondary mechanisms will be used to communicate and report during a security incident. Mechanisms can include phone calls, emails, or letters. Keep in mind that certain mechanisms, such as emails, can be affected during a security incident. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
17,17.7,Conduct Routine Incident Response Exercises,N/A,2,"Plan and conduct routine incident response exercises and scenarios for key personnel involved in the incident response process to prepare for responding to real-world incidents. Exercises need to test communication channels, decision making, and workflows. Conduct testing on an annual basis, at a minimum."
17,17.8,Conduct Post-Incident Reviews,N/A,2,Conduct post-incident reviews. Post-incident reviews help prevent incident recurrence through identifying lessons learned and follow-up action.
17,17.9,Establish and Maintain Security Incident Thresholds,N/A,3,"Establish and maintain security incident thresholds, including, at a minimum, differentiating between an incident and an event. Examples can include: abnormal activity, security vulnerability, security weakness, data breach, privacy incident, etc. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard."
18,18.1,Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program,N/A,2,"Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements."
18,18.2,Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests,Network,2,"Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box."
18,18.3,Remediate Penetration Test Findings,Network,2,Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise's policy for remediation scope and prioritization.
18,18.4,Validate Security Measures,Network,3,"Validate security measures after each penetration test. If deemed necessary, modify rulesets and capabilities to detect the techniques used during testing."
18,18.5,Perform Periodic Internal Penetration Tests,N/A,3,"Perform periodic internal penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. The testing may be clear box or opaque box."
